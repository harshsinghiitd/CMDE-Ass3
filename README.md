# Assignment-2:
Consider the linear boundary value problem,
Y’’ = p(x).Y’ + q(x).Y + r(x) ; x belongs to [a, b]
Boundary conditions: y(a) = s1 and y(b) = s2;
Create a program which implement linear shooting method (using two set of initial conditions)
for above BVP. Use the appropriate conditions, which are required for insuring uniqueness of
solution.

Note that:
1. Proper documentation should be used in the codes
2. You have to submit a program. Name of the file should be: “Ass3_EntryNu”
3. There will be evaluation of this assignment during some practical session, you will be
informed before.
4. Total Marks for this assignment = 4.
5. No cheating allowed.
